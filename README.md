# nnGames
Neural networks playing video games. This readme act as a progress report and contains dependencies of packages to install in order to successfully play with the model.

## Progress Summary
So far, we have :
  + Choose the game breakout from the Atari environment
  + Built the breakout game environment in python and understood how to interact with it
  + Built the model architecture
  
## Near Future Objectives
  + Convert 3d image into 2d efficiently (removing color dimension)
  + Implement a basic training paradigm
  + Implement the Q-learning paradigm
  
## Dependencies
To run the model successfully, you will need to install ;
  + [Tensorflow](https://gym.openai.com/docs) 
  + cmake
  + swig
  + Open AI gym
